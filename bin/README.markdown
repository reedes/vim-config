Inspired by Derek Wyattâ€™s video on coding Scala using Vim. In the video he
emphasized using a single Vim instance.

For those of us who have been frustrated by multiple graphical windows
open, the client/server capability.

Supports Mac OS X at present.

Any help in porting to other platforms (Linux, Windows, etc.) will be
welcomed. Please fork and offer pulls of tested ports. 

Not for use by those who have multiple windows or terminals open.
